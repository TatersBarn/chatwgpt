## CURRENTLY UNUSED SETTINGS FOR VOICE OUTPUT which is not yet available in the public release due to the complexity of configuring piper-tts
## feel free to try and figure it out, i left all my current 'working' code in the main file, commented out like this. it requires more than a simple uncommenting however

#voice=True
#voice_model=en_GB-semaine-medium.onnx
#speaker=2


############# EXPLANATION OF CONFIG SETTINGS

## target refers to the api endpoint that requests are made to, either openAI or a local compatible one, currently configured for OoobaBooga/text-generation-webui
# targets: [openai, ooba]
# Use 'ooba' for local openAI API compatible model frameworks, script is preconfigured to use oobabooga settings at localhost port 5000 127.0.0.1:5000

## model refers to the actual model referenced in api calls, the OpenAI ones work and Oobabooga ones should as well however the functionality for this is finnicky, best to set these manually or in the WebUI itself
# model_choice choices: [gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo, oobastank]
# 'oobastank' included as acceptable model for local models, will default when 'target' is set. This is purely cosmetic but no, you arent allowed to change it. (you have the source code though go wild.)

## prompts are the System Messages that instruct the bot how to behave
# prompt/system messages supported: [concisechat, concisepilot, gptlike, oobafree, oobahot, oobadark, shirlaken, shortlaken]
# read or modify these prompts in OobaFunctions.py

## Oneout is an old debugging setting from development, it limits execution to waitin for a single response and exiting afterward. good for batching multiple lines from a file to get synthesized output


##### CURRENTLY UNUSED SETTINGS FOR VOICE - EXPLANATIONS

# voice = True :  Synthesized Speech Output using Piper-tts. voice = False :  No speech synthesis, text-only chat mode

# voice_model for Piper-tts, in onnx format. some voices have multiple speakers to choose from, read baseline details and see their model card links below.

# speaker: some piper-tts voices have multiple speaker options. you will need to see the .onnx.conf for the multi-speaker model you are interested in using. some information on those I use are below
